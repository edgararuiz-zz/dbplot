Title: Simplifies Plotting Data Inside Databases
Description: Leverages 'dplyr' to process the calculations of a plot inside a database. 
    This package provides helper functions that abstract the work at three levels:
    outputs a 'ggplot', outputs the calculations, outputs the formula
    needed to calculate bins.
