\title{Raster plot}
\usage{
dbplot_raster(data, x, y, fill = n(), resolution = 100, complete = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A table (tbl)}

\item{x}{A continuous variable}

\item{y}{A continuous variable}

\item{fill}{The aggregation formula. Defaults to count (n)}

\item{resolution}{The number of bins created by variable. The highest the number, the more records
can be potentially imported from the sourd}

\item{complete}{Uses tidyr::complete to include empty bins. Inserts value of 0.}
}
\description{
To visualize two continuous variables, we typically resort to a Scatter plot. However,
this may not be practical when visualizing millions or billions of dots representing the
intersections of the two variables. A Raster plot may be a better option,
because it concentrates the intersections into squares that are easier to parse visually.

Uses very generic dplyr code to aggregate data and ggplot2 to create
a raster plot.  Because of this approach,
the calculations automatically run inside the database if `data` has
a database or sparklyr connection. The `class()` of such tables
in R are: tbl_sql, tbl_dbi, tbl_spark
}
\details{
There are two considerations when using a Raster plot with a database. Both considerations are related
to the size of the results downloaded from the database:

- The number of bins requested: The higher the bins value is, the more data is downloaded from the database.

- How concentrated the data is: This refers to how many intersections return a value. The more intersections
without a value,
the less data is downloaded from the database.
