Leverages `dplyr` to process the calculations of a plot inside a database.  This package provides helper functions that abstract the work at three levels:
    
1. Functions that ouput a `ggplot2` object
2. Functions that outputs a `data.frame` object with the calculations
3. Creates the formula needed to calculate bins for a Histogram or a Raster plot

## Installation

You can install the released version from CRAN:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("dbplot")
```

Or the the development version from GitHub, using the `remotes` package:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("edgararuiz/dbplot")
```


## Connecting to a data source

- For more information on how to connect to databases, including Hive, please visit http://db.rstudio.com 

- To use Spark, please visit the `sparklyr` official website: http://spark.rstudio.com

## Example

In addition to database connections, the functions work with `sparklyr`. A local `RSQLite` database will be used for the examples in this README.  


```{r}
library(DBI)
library(odbc)
library(dplyr)

con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
db_flights <- copy_to(con, nycflights13::flights, "flights")
```

## `ggplot`

### Histogram

By default `dbplot_histogram()` creates a 30 bin histogram

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

db_flights %>% 
  dbplot_histogram(distance)
```

Use `binwidth` to fix the bin size

```{r}
db_flights %>% 
  dbplot_histogram(distance, binwidth = 400)
```

Because it outputs a `ggplot2` object, more customization can be done

```{r}
db_flights %>% 
  dbplot_histogram(distance, binwidth = 400) +
  labs(title = "Flights - Distance traveled") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Raster

To visualize two continuous variables, we typically resort to a Scatter plot. However, this may not be practical when visualizing millions or billions of dots representing the intersections of the two variables. A Raster plot may be a better option, because it concentrates the intersections into squares that are easier to parse visually.

A Raster plot basically does the same as a Histogram. It takes two continuous variables and creates discrete 2-dimensional bins represented as squares in the plot. It then determines either the number of rows inside each square or processes some aggregation, like an average.


- If no `fill` argument is passed, the default calculation will be count, `n()`
```{r}
db_flights %>%
  dbplot_raster(sched_dep_time, sched_arr_time) 
```


- Pass an aggregation formula that can run inside the database
```{r}
db_flights %>%
  dbplot_raster(
    sched_dep_time, 
    sched_arr_time, 
    mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) 
```

- Increase or decrease for more, or less, definition.  The `resolution` argument controls that, it defaults to 100 
```{r}
db_flights %>%
  dbplot_raster(
    sched_dep_time, 
    sched_arr_time, 
    mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    resolution = 20
    ) 
```

### Bar Plot

- `dbplot_bar()` defaults to a tally() of each value in a discrete variable
```{r}
db_flights %>%
  dbplot_bar(origin)
```


- Pass a formula, and column name, that will be operated for each value in the discrete variable
```{r}
db_flights %>%
  dbplot_bar(origin, avg_delay =  mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Line plot

- `dbplot_line()` defaults to a tally() of each value in a discrete variable
```{r}
db_flights %>%
  dbplot_line(month)
```

- Pass a formula that will be operated for each value in the discrete variable
```{r}
db_flights %>%
  dbplot_line(month, avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Boxplot

It expects a discrete variable to group by, and a continuous variable to calculate the percentiles and IQR. It doesn't calculate outliers. It has been tested with the following connections:

- MS SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- `sparklyr`

Here is an example using `dbplot_boxplot()` with a local data frame:

```{r}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  dbplot_boxplot(origin, distance)
```



## Calculation functions

If a more customized plot is needed, the data the underpins the plots can also be accessed:

1. `db_compute_bins()` - Returns a data frame with the bins and count per bin
2. `db_compute_count()` - Returns a data frame with the count per discrete value
3. `db_compute_raster()` -  Returns a data frame with the results per x/y intersection
4. `db_compute_raster2()` -  Returns same as `db_compute_raster()` function plus the coordinates of the x/y boxes
5. `db_compute_boxplot()` -  Returns a data frame with boxplot calculations


```{r}
db_flights %>%
  db_compute_bins(arr_delay) 
```

The data can be piped to a plot

```{r}
db_flights %>%
  filter(arr_delay < 100 , arr_delay > -50) %>%
  db_compute_bins(arr_delay) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(arr_delay, count, fill = count))
```


## `db_bin()`

Uses 'rlang' to build the formula needed to create the bins of a numeric variable in an un-evaluated fashion. This way, the formula can be then passed inside a dplyr verb.

```{r}
db_bin(var)
```


```{r}
db_flights %>%
  group_by(x = !! db_bin(arr_delay)) %>%
  tally()
```

```{r}
db_flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  group_by(x = !! db_bin(arr_delay)) %>%
  tally()%>%
  collect %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x, n))
```

```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
